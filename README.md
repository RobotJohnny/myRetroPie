### fix_gamelist.sh
When you run the EmulationStation default scraper (using thegamesdb) likelihood is you'll now have duplicate games in the UI

This simple script renames those duplicates with the original filename without it's file extension. 

Currently it does not remove/replace box art, so duplicate box art will still exist

eventually my aim is to make this script fix the gamelist entirely and remove the duplicate box art
